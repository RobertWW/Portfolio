				<h2>A brief to not-so-brief bio</h2>
				<p>My name is Robert Weigel; I was born in San Antonio, Texas but moved to Cincinnati shortly after. I went to High School in Cincinnati and went to college at Xavier University, also in Cincinnati. A <em>lot</em> of my life has been in Cincinnati. Though, through the Army, I've travelled to Washington, Colorado, and Virginia. My Korean heritage has brought me to South Korea a few times as well.</p>
				<p>I'm currently a Second Lieutenant in the US Army Reserves, but I'd really love to be a web developer. I started into coding when I was a kid: messing around with scripts to cheat at a computer game. Who knew it would turn into something I love?</p>
				<p>I'm still in Cincinnati, but my goals in life stretch way beyond the state border. I made a list of things I regularly enjoy doing, but I just love...<em>life.</em> I want to experience as many things as I possibly can!</p>
